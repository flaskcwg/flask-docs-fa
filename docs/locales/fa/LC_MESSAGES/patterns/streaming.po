"Sometimes you want to send an enormous amount of data to the client, much"

"This is a basic view function that generates a lot of CSV data on the "
"fly. The trick is to have an inner function that uses a generator to "
"generate data and to then invoke that function and pass it to a response "

"The Jinja2 template engine supports rendering a template piece by piece, "
"returning an iterator of strings. Flask provides the "
":func:`~flask.stream_template` and :func:`~flask.stream_template_string` "
"functions to make this easier to use."

"The :data:`~flask.request` will not be active while the generator is "

"If your generator function relies on data in ``request``, use the "
":func:`~flask.stream_with_context` wrapper. This will keep the request "

#~ "environment on the application and to"
#~ " call :meth:`~jinja2.Template.stream` instead of"
#~ " :meth:`~jinja2.Template.render` which returns a"
#~ " stream object instead of a string."
#~ "  Since we're bypassing the Flask "
#~ "template render functions and using the"
#~ " template object itself we have to"
#~ " make sure to update the render "
#~ "context ourselves by calling "
#~ ":meth:`~flask.Flask.update_template_context`. The template"
#~ " is then evaluated as the stream "
#~ "is iterated over.  Since each time "
#~ "you do a yield the server will "
#~ "flush the content to the client "
#~ "you might want to buffer up a "
#~ "few items in the template which "
#~ "you can do with ``rv.enable_buffering(size)``."

#~ "around during the execution of the "
#~ "generator::"
