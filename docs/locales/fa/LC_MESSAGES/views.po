#: ../../views.rst:9
msgid ""
"A class-based view is a class that acts as a view function. Because it is"
" a class, different instances of the class can be created with different "
"arguments, to change the behavior of the view. This is also known as "
"generic, reusable, or pluggable views."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:14
msgid ""
"An example of where this is useful is defining a class that creates an "
"API based on the database model it is initialized with."

"Let's walk through an example converting a view function to a view class."
" We start with a view function that queries a list of users then renders "
"a template to show the list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:35
msgid ""
"This works for the user model, but let's say you also had more models "
"that needed list pages. You'd need to write another view function for "
"each model, even though the only thing that would change is the model and"
" template name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:40
msgid ""
"Instead, you can write a :class:`View` subclass that will query a model "
"and render a template. As the first step, we'll convert the view to a "
"class without any customization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:55
msgid ""
"The :meth:`View.dispatch_request` method is the equivalent of the view "
"function. Calling :meth:`View.as_view` method will create a view function"
" that can be registered on the app with its "
":meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` method. The first argument to "
"``as_view`` is the name to use to refer to the view with "
":func:`~flask.url_for`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:64
msgid ""
"You can't decorate the class with ``@app.route()`` the way you'd do with "
"a basic view function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:67
msgid ""
"Next, we need to be able to register the same view class for different "
"models and templates, to make it more useful than the original function. "
"The class will take two arguments, the model and template, and store them"
" on ``self``. Then ``dispatch_request`` can reference these instead of "
"hard-coded values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:84
msgid ""
"Remember, we create the view function with ``View.as_view()`` instead of "
"creating the class directly. Any extra arguments passed to ``as_view`` "
"are then passed when creating the class. Now we can register the same "
"view to handle multiple models."

msgid "View Lifetime and ``self``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:125
msgid ""
"By default, a new instance of the view class is created every time a "
"request is handled. This means that it is safe to write other data to "
"``self`` during the request, since the next request will not see it, "
"unlike other forms of global state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:130
msgid ""
"However, if your view class needs to do a lot of complex initialization, "
"doing it for every request is unnecessary and can be inefficient. To "
"avoid this, set :attr:`View.init_every_request` to ``False``, which will "
"only create one instance of the class and use it for every request. In "
"this case, writing to ``self`` is not safe. If you need to store data "
"during the request, use :data:`~flask.g` instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:137
msgid ""
"In the ``ListView`` example, nothing writes to ``self`` during the "
"request, so it is more efficient to create a single instance."

"The view class itself is not the view function. View decorators need to "

#: ../../views.rst:171
msgid ""
"If you didn't set ``decorators``, you could apply them manually instead. "
"This is equivalent to:"

#: ../../views.rst:196
msgid ""
"A common pattern is to register a view with ``methods=[\"GET\", "

"do. Setting :attr:`View.methods` is equivalent to passing the list of "
"methods to ``add_url_rule`` or ``route``."

#~ msgid "Basic Principle"

#~ "Consider you have a function that "
#~ "loads a list of objects from the"
#~ " database and renders into a "
#~ "template::"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This is simple and flexible, but "
#~ "if you want to provide this view"
#~ " in a generic fashion that can "
#~ "be adapted to other models and "
#~ "templates as well you might want "
#~ "more flexibility.  This is where "
#~ "pluggable class-based views come into"
#~ " place.  As the first step to "
#~ "convert this into a class based "
#~ "view you would do this::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As you can see what you have "
#~ "to do is to create a subclass "
#~ "of :class:`flask.views.View` and implement "
#~ ":meth:`~flask.views.View.dispatch_request`.  Then we "
#~ "have to convert that class into an"
#~ " actual view function by using the"
#~ " :meth:`~flask.views.View.as_view` class method.  "
#~ "The string you pass to that "
#~ "function is the name of the "
#~ "endpoint that view will then have.  "
#~ "But this by itself is not helpful,"
#~ " so let's refactor the code a "
#~ "bit::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This of course is not that helpful"
#~ " for such a small example, but "
#~ "it's good enough to explain the "
#~ "basic principle.  When you have a "
#~ "class-based view the question comes "
#~ "up what ``self`` points to.  The "
#~ "way this works is that whenever "
#~ "the request is dispatched a new "
#~ "instance of the class is created "
#~ "and the :meth:`~flask.views.View.dispatch_request` "
#~ "method is called with the parameters "
#~ "from the URL rule.  The class "
#~ "itself is instantiated with the "
#~ "parameters passed to the "
#~ ":meth:`~flask.views.View.as_view` function. For "
#~ "instance you can write a class "
#~ "like this::"

#~ "Pluggable views are attached to the "
#~ "application like a regular function by"
#~ " either using :func:`~flask.Flask.route` or "
#~ "better :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule`.  That "
#~ "however also means that you would "
#~ "have to provide the names of the"
#~ " HTTP methods the view supports when"
#~ " you attach this.  In order to "
#~ "move that information to the class "
#~ "you can provide a "
#~ ":attr:`~flask.views.View.methods` attribute that has"
#~ " this information::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Method Based Dispatching"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "For RESTful APIs it's especially helpful"
#~ " to execute a different function for"
#~ " each HTTP method.  With the "
#~ ":class:`flask.views.MethodView` you can easily "
#~ "do that.  Each HTTP method maps to"
#~ " a method of the class with the"
#~ " same name (just in lowercase)::"

#~ "class."

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Since the view class itself is not"
#~ " the view function that is added "
#~ "to the routing system it does not"
#~ " make much sense to decorate the "
#~ "class itself. Instead you either have"
#~ " to decorate the return value of "
#~ ":meth:`~flask.views.View.as_view` by hand::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Starting with Flask 0.8 there is "
#~ "also an alternative way where you "
#~ "can specify a list of decorators "
#~ "to apply in the class declaration::"

#~ "makes a lot of sense to implement"
#~ " such an API based on the "
#~ ":class:`~flask.views.MethodView`.  That said, you"
#~ " will notice that the API will "
#~ "require different URL rules that go "
#~ "to the same method view most of"
