"Flask makes it pretty easy to write a web application. But there are "
"quite a few different parts to an application and to each request it "
"handles. Knowing what happens during application setup, serving, and "
"handling requests will help you know what's possible in Flask and how to "
"structure your application."

msgid "Application Setup"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lifecycle.rst:13
msgid ""
"The first step in creating a Flask application is creating the "
"application object. Each Flask application is an instance of the "
":class:`.Flask` class, which collects all configuration, extensions, and "
"views."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lifecycle.rst:31
msgid ""
"This is known as the \"application setup phase\", it's the code you write"
" that's outside any view functions or other handlers. It can be split up "
"between different modules and sub-packages, but all code that you want to"
" be part of your application must be imported in order for it to be "
"registered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lifecycle.rst:36
msgid ""
"All application setup must be completed before you start serving your "
"application and handling requests. This is because WSGI servers divide "
"work between multiple workers, or can be distributed across multiple "
"machines. If the configuration changed in one worker, there's no way for "
"Flask to ensure consistency between other workers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lifecycle.rst:41
msgid ""
"Flask tries to help developers catch some of these setup ordering issues "
"by showing an error if setup-related methods are called after requests "
"are handled. In that case you'll see this error:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lifecycle.rst:45
msgid ""
"The setup method 'route' can no longer be called on the application. It "
"has already handled its first request, any changes will not be applied "
"consistently. Make sure all imports, decorators, functions, etc. needed "
"to set up the application are done before running it."
msgstr ""

"However, it is not possible for Flask to detect all cases of out-of-order"
" setup. In general, don't do anything to modify the ``Flask`` app object "
"and ``Blueprint`` objects from within view functions that run during "
"requests. This includes:"

"Flask is a WSGI application framework. The other half of WSGI is the WSGI"
" server. During development, Flask, through Werkzeug, provides a "
"development WSGI server with the ``flask run`` CLI command. When you are "

" see :doc:`deploying/index`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lifecycle.rst:72

"Regardless of what server you're using, it will follow the :pep:`3333` "
"WSGI spec. The WSGI server will be told how to access your Flask "
"application object, which is the WSGI application. Then it will start "
"listening for HTTP requests, translate the request data into a WSGI "
"environ, and call the WSGI application with that data. The WSGI "
"application will return data that is translated into an HTTP response."

"The WSGI application above is a callable that behaves in a certain way. "
"Middleware is a WSGI application that wraps another WSGI application. "
"It's a similar concept to Python decorators. The outermost middleware "
"will be called by the server. It can modify the data passed to it, then "
"call the WSGI application (or further middleware) that it wraps, and so "
"on. And it can take the return value of that call and modify it further."

"A common middleware you'll see used with Flask is Werkzeug's "
":class:`~werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix`, which modifies the "

"For us, the interesting part of the steps above is when Flask gets called"

"lot to handle the request and generate the response. At the most basic, "
"it will match the URL to a view function, call the view function, and "
