"Prefer using :doc:`gunicorn` with eventlet workers rather than using "
"`eventlet`_ directly. Gunicorn provides a much more configurable and "
"production-tested server."

"`eventlet`_ allows writing asynchronous, coroutine-based code that looks "
"like standard synchronous Python. It uses `greenlet`_ to enable task "
"switching without writing ``async/await`` or using ``asyncio``."

":doc:`gevent` is another library that does the same thing. Certain "

"eventlet provides a WSGI server that can handle many connections at once "
"instead of one per worker process. You must actually use eventlet in your"
" own code to see any benefit to using the server."

"When using eventlet, greenlet>=1.0 is required, otherwise context locals "

"PyPy>=7.3.7 is required."

"eventlet should not be run as root because it would cause your "
"application code to run as root, which is not secure. However, this means"
" it will not be possible to bind to port 80 or 443. Instead, a reverse "
"proxy such as :doc:`nginx` or :doc:`apache-httpd` should be used in front"
" of eventlet."

"You can bind to all external IPs on a non-privileged port by using "
"``0.0.0.0`` in the server arguments shown in the previous section. Don't "
"do this when using a reverse proxy setup, otherwise it will be possible "
"to bypass the proxy."

"``0.0.0.0`` is not a valid address to navigate to, you'd use a specific "
