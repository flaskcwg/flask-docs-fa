"When using a reverse proxy, or many Python hosting platforms, the proxy "
"will intercept and forward all external requests to the local WSGI "
"server."

"From the WSGI server and Flask application's perspectives, requests are "
"now coming from the HTTP server to the local address, rather than from "
"the remote address to the external server address."

"HTTP servers should set ``X-Forwarded-`` headers to pass on the real "
"values to the application. The application can then be told to trust and "
"use those values by wrapping it with the "
":doc:`werkzeug:middleware/proxy_fix` middleware provided by Werkzeug."

msgid ""
"This middleware should only be used if the application is actually behind"
" a proxy, and should be configured with the number of proxies that are "
"chained in front of it. Not all proxies set all the headers. Since "
"incoming headers can be faked, you must set how many proxies are setting "
"each header so the middleware knows what to trust."

"Remember, only apply this middleware if you are behind a proxy, and set "
"the correct number of proxies that set each header. It can be a security "
"issue if you get this configuration wrong."
