"`nginx`_ is a fast, production level HTTP server. When serving your "
"application with one of the WSGI servers listed in :doc:`index`, it is "
"often good or necessary to put a dedicated HTTP server in front of it. "
"This \"reverse proxy\" can handle incoming requests, TLS, and other "
"security and performance concerns better than the WSGI server."

"Nginx can be installed using your system package manager, or a pre-built "
"executable for Windows. Installing and running Nginx itself is outside "
"the scope of this doc. This page outlines the basics of configuring Nginx"
" to proxy your application. Be sure to read its documentation to "
"understand what features are available."
